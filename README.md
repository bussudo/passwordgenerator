# 03: Password Generator

This project demonstrates a password generator where the user selects from the choices presented whether numeric, upper case, lower case, or special characters.  User also selects the desired length of the password, a number between 8 - 128.

I chose to offer the user many of the special characters that exist from a list I created.  I also offered the alphabet, both upper case and lower case letters.
